# lambert_w
A C++ library that can compute the Lambert W function for floating point and complex number types.

For now it is slowly being prepared to be submitted to the Boost review board.

This branch is dedicated to reduce the library's standards requirement to C++11, increasing compatibility. In its current state it does not compile.
